45184	Nihilism	Nihilism  Nihilism comes from the Latin nihil, or nothing. It is the belief that values are falsely invented. The term nihilism can also be used to describe the idea that life, or the world, has no distinct meaning or purpose. Nihilists believe that there are no true morals. The term was made popular by Ivan Turgenev's novel Fathers and Sons. Bazarov, the hero in it, was a nihilist. Most people think of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche when they think about nihilism, because he said that morals were invented. Even people who know about Nietzsche call him a nihilist (someone who practices nihilism.) But in his books, Nietzsche said that people needed to create their own morals to get over nihilism. Other than him, very few famous philosophers are nihilists. However, nihilism is still an important topic for students learning all the major philosophy categories. Apart from Nietzsche, a popular text which draws heavily on nihilism is the novel Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky. Nihilism is associated with postmodernism.

45195	Coronary heart disease	Coronary heart disease  Coronary heart disease, also called coronary artery disease, is a heart disease. ("Coronary" means "the blood vessels of the heart".) Coronary heart disease causes plaque to build up inside the coronary arteries. This causes the coronary arteries to become narrower. An artery is a blood vessel - a tube that carries blood. After the heart supplies blood that is full of oxygen and nutrients, the arteries carry the blood to different parts of the body. The coronary arteries are very important: they supply blood to the heart muscle. So when the coronary arteries become narrower, less blood gets to the heart muscle. Most people with coronary heart disease can feel healthy for years before they start experiencing symptoms. The most common symptom is a heart attack. If coronary heart disease is not treated, some of the plaques in the coronary arteries can break away and block the blood flow to the heart. Coronary heart disease is the most common cause of sudden death. It is also the most common cause of death in people over 65 years old. Men are 10 times more likely to get coronary heart disease than women. Atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a form of heart disease. It causes fatty materials (like cholesterol) to build up in the arteries, forming harder materials called plaques. This causes the arteries to become harder. It also makes it more difficult for blood to flow through the arteries. This can cause blood clots to form, blocking blood from traveling through the arteries. Small pieces of plaque can also break off and block smaller blood vessels. If an artery becomes blocked completely, it causes serious problems. All cells, tissues, and organs in the body need oxygen and nutrients (carried by blood) to survive. If cells or tissues are not supplied with enough blood, they will die. (This is called necrosis.) When this happens in the coronary arteries, a section of the heart dies. This can cause a myocardial infraction (a heart attack) to happen. Preventing coronary heart disease. People can do many different things to keep themselves from getting coronary heart disease: Atherosclerosis  
45200	Fructose	Fructose  Fructose is a simple sugar (monosaccharide) found in many foods. It is also one of the three most important blood sugars, the other two being glucose and galactose. Honey; tree fruits; berries; melons; and some root vegetables, such as beets, sweet potatoes, parsnips and onions, contain fructose, usually with sucrose and glucose.
